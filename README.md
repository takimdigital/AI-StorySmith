# AI StorySmith: The Open Narrative Forge
Generate an entire books using local LLM, ollama, Lmstudio etc.

## 📖 Overview

Welcome to AI StorySmith, a humble forge where narratives are crafted with the help of Local Large Language Models (LLMs). This is a place for storytellers, dreamers, and anyone who believes in the power of words and the magic of AI. It's a zero-cost alternative to GPT models, with a focus on privacy and offline creation. I'm not a coder by any stretch – just a person with a passion for stories, sharing my journey of bringing tales to life for my family and now, for everyone.

## 🌟 Features

- **Zero-Cost Storytelling**: Dive into AI-powered creativity without worrying about expenses.
- **Local LLM Utilization**: Run everything on your machine, no cloud dependencies.
- **Cascading Creation Process**: Watch your book take shape one chapter at a time.
- **Customization at Heart**: Tweak models and prompts to fit the narrative in your mind's eye.
- **Human-Centric Design**: Built from a non-developer's perspective, for ease and simplicity.
